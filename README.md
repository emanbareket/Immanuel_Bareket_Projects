Klotski_Solver: Finds the minimmum steps solution for any Klotski puzzle. The program uses BFS, and optimizes the runtime by never revisiting an identical or symmetrical position. Input can either be a matrix representing a puzzle, or an image of a valid puzzle, however there is no user interface so the input is hard coded into the main function. All necessary functions are in the file "Klotski_Solver.py", and three test images are provided.

The rest of the files are examples of coursework including training and testing of various different machine learning/NLP models. 
Unfortunately, the files used to train the model are too large to upload to github.
